# How to use InPUT4J

## Requirement
Make sure to have Java JDK 1.6 (or higher) installed.

## Download Libraries (User)

If you want to use InPUT4j in your project, download the latest InPUT4j\*.jar from the *bin* folder and add it together with all jars within the *lib* folder to the classpath of your project. The respective source jar's can also be found in the *bin* folder. You should now have full source code access to the InPUT4j API.

## Download Examples (User)

The *Source* folder contains various projects with examples of different complexity.

## Download Source (Developer)

The *Source* folder contains the core sources for all InPUT4j modules. Each subfolder of *Source* is an Eclipse project that can be imported into Eclipse 3.\* or 4.\* \(Main Menu File/Import...\), and Netbeans 7.\* \([see here](http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/import-eclipse.html)\). You might have to change the JRE to one available on your system \(Project Explorer rightclick on the Project/Properties/Build-Path ... Libraries ... Add Library ... JRE System Library\). You would want to remove the default project JRE in that case once you are at it. The readme file in *Source* briefly summarizes the modules and their responsibilities.
