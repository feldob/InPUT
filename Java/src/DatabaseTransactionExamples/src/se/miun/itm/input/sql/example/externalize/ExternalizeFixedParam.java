/**
 * This class extends the relative param definition example, by illustrating how a
 * constant decision can be externalized as a parameter, using an existing InPUT descriptor.
 * This can be valuable, if you right now want to keep a parameter fixed, but might want to
 * play with it in a later stage.
 * 
 * Starting from the example in RelativeInPUT, you have to:
 * 1) identify the constant to be extracted (the '1' in the formula)
 * 2) substitute the constant with a variable identifier (e.g. "c")
 * 3) add the variable retrieval  with the identifier using InPUT to the code.
 * 4) add the variable as a parameter to the design space. If desired, it can be
 * set to a fixed value, in order to have it specified as a degree that could easily be
 * adjusted in a later stage.
