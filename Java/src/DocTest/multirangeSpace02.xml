    <!--
        A mismatched multi-range declaration with one or more missing max
        values is legal in the sense that a DesignSpace can be created.
        However, whether generating a value for the parameter will succeed
        or throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is random.

        If a range with matching endpoints is picked by chance, then the
        instantiation works. If, on the other hand, a min without a
        matching max is chosen, then there will be an exception.

        This can be demonstrated by defining one parameter with most of its
        ranges matched and one parameter with most of them unmatched.
        Generating values for both should have different probabilities of
        throwing an exception.

        A is defined over 5 ranges, 1 of which is matched. The probability
        of successfully generating a value should therefore be 1 out of 5,
        or 20%.
        B is defined over 5 ranges, 4 of which are matched. The probability
        of successfully generating a value should therefore be 4 out of 5,
        or 80%.
