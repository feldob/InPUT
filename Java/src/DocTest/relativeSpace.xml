    <!--
        The parameters X and Y are "fixed" to the value 2. Y is literally
        fixed to 2 while X simply has its range restricted to only include
        the value 2.
        A and B are defined in terms of X and Y, respectively. Both are
        expected to always be initialized to 4 (twice the size of X and Y).

        C and D are limited to exactly the same value as A and B (4), and
        both reference X. However, only one of the endpoints contains a
        reference. The other endpoint is a literal 4.

        When creating a design, all values are initialized correctly.
        However, calling next() on the design space does not return the
        correct values for A-D.
        For some reason, A and B always return 0, while C and D return
        random (invalid) values.

        It looks as though the references are evaluated to 0(*) which in this
        case means that the range will be 0 - 0 for A and B and 0 - 4 for D
        (inclusive). However, this doesn't explain why C seems to be using
        the same range. A range of 4 to 0 shouldn't even be allowed.

        * Using an expression such as "X-5" will produce a lower limit of
        -5, which suggests that the expression is indeed evaluated, but that
        the referenced parameter is simply set to 0.
